# CSCA08 Material
I co-presented a review seminar with Mohammad Moustafa to help over 200 CSCA08 students review for their final exam. We covered topics like iteration, lists and string methods, dictionaries, files, unit testing, sorting algorithms. The PDF of the presentation contains an **Additonal** section where I  followed-up to questions that students personally asked me.
