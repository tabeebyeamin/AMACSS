# CSCA48 Review Material
I made the Midterm Study Guide with fellow AMACSS CS representative David Yue. We cover basics about the C language and the difference
between it and Python. We covered topics like data types, methods for those data types as well as pointers and memory management. We covered some basics about Linked Lists, including common methods such as insertion and deletion.
